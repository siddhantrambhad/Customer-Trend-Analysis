# 📊 Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow**, covering data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, and business intelligence reporting. The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights using industry-standard tools and best practices.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- The dataset is loaded using **Python (pandas)**
- It contains structured data suitable for analysis and reporting
- Data is cleaned and prepared before analysis
- Missing values, duplicates, and data types are handled appropriately

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
- **Power BI** (dashboard & visualization)
- **Gamma** (presentation / PPT creation)

---
